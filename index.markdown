## You learn about pasta, I learn about P2P University
I am creating this course about pasta carbonara, in order to learn how to create a course for P2P University. I will then help someone else create a serious, legitimate course.

## Webpages are confusing. I only took CIS 112.

In CIS 112, we learned some HTML and CSS. We also did a JavaScript assignment. I did poorly on this assignment.

However, P2P has made it easy for me, providing a skeleton site and detailed isntructions.

## Pasta is not confusing. It is delicious. 

I became truly passionate about pasta around two years ago, thanks to a dear friend who studied abroad. In this course, I will show you how to make spaghetti carbonara while providing you with some background cooking knowledge. Carbonara is a simple dish to make; it is also a simple dish to fuck up. It only requires four-ish ingredients, but you do need a lot of practice.
